# Uber Clone with REACT NATIVE!

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

![Screenshots](screenshot.png)

This is a React Native app clone of Uber that uses Tailwind CSS and React Native Navigation libraries. The app provides similar features as Uber such as booking a ride, tracking the ride, and payment processing. It also uses Google Maps to provide location-based services. However, due to the paid Google API key, the project has not been completed yet.

This project is ideal for React Native developers who are interested in building a ride-sharing app using popular libraries and tools. The project is open-source, so developers can contribute to it and learn from it.
